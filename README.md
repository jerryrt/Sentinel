Autmotatic UI Log System

This project is designed to implement log for important ui activities without modification on the original ui code.

By default, the following events will be logged.

UIViewController
  view did appear
  view did disappear

UITableView
  cell selected
  cell deselected
  
UICollectionView
  item selected
  item deselected
  
I hope there will be a data mining system to support the studying of the log.
That will helps the devs to learn how the user behavior without adding log manually.
